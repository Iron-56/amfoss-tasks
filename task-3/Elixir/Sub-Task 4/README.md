The write function in Elixir writes a single line to the file. Using Integer parse the input string is assigned to n variable and the rem function acts as modulus operator. The counter variable first increases by 2 from 1 to half of number of rows then decreases. Replication of strings is used rather than an extra for loop. Concatinated string is written to a variable using <> and then written to the file.
