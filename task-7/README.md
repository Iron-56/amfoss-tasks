# Pirate's Dilemma

## My Approach

Using bs4 I extracted the available subtitles from the html using request from the url. The url is generated from a list of parameters provided by the user. By observation I found that imdbid overrites the use of hash and language filter in the url.

## Review

I found this task quite frustrating but useful in the future. I learnt about web scraping using bs4 and using the url to search. The web scraping process was a bit time consuming.
