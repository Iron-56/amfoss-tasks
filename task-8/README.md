# Build Cross-platform apps with Flutter

# Hello!
I’m Nandu Krishna and I am a junior student of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. I’m a passionate programmer who’s journey is to become a great and well known developer.

My journey began way back around 5 years before and I started with Adobe Flash. Then I went to play around with Scratch and been stuck there for some time. Then I learnt some JavaScript and HTML basics and tried to do the same projects I made with Scratch but more efficient. Then I found about C++ and was amazed by its capability. I made a simple Game engine with C++ using OpenGL. Then I tried out some basics of Rust, Java and finally C#. I found out that no programming languages are perfect and they have their own advantages and disadvantages. My most liked programming language would be C++. Now in this blog I would like to introduce you to the world of cross-platform application development.

## Setup Android Studio and Flutter
Firstly you need to install Android Studio and Flutter in your device.

1. Creating a project in Android studio: Go to the bin folder of the android-studio folder.

```
$ sudo chmod +x studio.sh
$ ./studio.sh
```
2. After the IDE launches open up SDK manager and find Flutter under plugins and install it if it isn’t installed. Make sure you have Android API downloaded in the checkbox under Languages & Frameworks.

3. Now you can choose New Project and select flutter at the bottom and you are good to go.

## Launching the App
First you need to select Linux (desktop) or Windows according to your OS in the Flutter device selection. If you can’t see the corresponding device you can select refresh option. Then you can select the arrow which shows Run “main.dart” and it will launch in some time.

## Building the App
Select the Main menu (the three lines at the top left) and go for Build > Flutter > Build APK for android devices. You need to licence your app to publish to Play Store.

## My App
While I was doing the tasks for am-FOSS praveshan (recruitment process of the am-FOSS club in Amrita), I found this task Hero-Dex and I have developed an app named Hero-Dex which lets you to browse many superheroes and see their statistics. I found this task most interesting because It helped me to learn something critical in becoming a developer. I saw that Flutter is almost like HTML. After I finished some basics of Flutter I developed a simple login app for a relative of mine. Learning Flutter initially was quite difficult I would say but It soon became a piece of cake but the thing I found challenging was about was the mobile view because it had to be ideal, effective and fitting the theme.
