# HERO-DEX: An android and IOS app for browsing heroes!

## My Approach

I used a stateful widget to update the widgets as required. I used grid view for my purpose because I felt that it can display more heroes at the same time. I found the function setState very useful but I encountered a bug where the setState function would not update the favorite icon. Initially I thought of adding a new page but I found out that it became very difficult so I added a details panel to display hero details. Also with that I had to create a hero details list to store the data. I also had to create a favorites list to store favorite heroes.

## Review

The task was very new to me and difficult to understand at first but it became somewhat easier later. I aim to develop on flutter later as I get time. I saw that I was running out of time so I had to quickly finish this app therefore, I feel like this app is lacking some final touchings.
