# Task-2

This README explains how I did terminal chaos task.

## Part-1

I installed tree command then using that I found parchment.txt.


## Part-2

I searched what all the branches that are present using git branch. I got the filenames using grep and pipe operator grep -rlE 'good.*holy|holy.*good'. I rearranged the letters according to the docs and got the holy spell (LnnmknnlLhrsdhk). Then I defeated the boss using that code.

I got LightBookA and Celestial Veil Amulet from the boss

## Part-3

I switched to the dark realm I using git checkout The-Dark-Realm-I. Using tree I found the chest and navigated into there and used Celestial amulet to open chest and got dark book I. After that I checked out dark realm II using git checkout The-Dark-Realm-II and got Dark book II.

## Part-4

I got the (godsuite link)[https://github.com/amansxcalibur/Terminal-Chaos-GodSuite] using echo "aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2FtYW5zeGNhbGlidXIvVGVybWluYWwtQ2hhb3MtR29kU3VpdGU=" | base64 -d by combining the codes in order.

## Part-5

I downloaded the god suite repo and searched the log using git log -p -6 and I decoded the base64 code to get (link to some github repo)[https://github.com/angrezichatterbox/To-the-stars-and-realms-unseen].
I ran the victory.py program to get the screenshot.
