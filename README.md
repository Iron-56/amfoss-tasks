# am-FOSS Tasks

## About Me

Hello!
My name is Nandu Krishna and I love programming till day 1.
I know quite a good amount of programming languaage basics like C++, C, Java, Python, Javascript, C#, and some Rust. I once made a Game Engine using C++ & OpenGL. App development is one of the main reason I am joinning am-FOSS. Other than coding and stuff I love playing Chess, Badminton (and some PC games :P)

## Why should we choose you?

I aim to improve myself and I like to help others in the process and as by the end I want to be perfect as a developer. 

## How do you intend to contribute back to the club?

I can help others in the club in the field where my knowledge shines. I want to expand my knowledge and excel in academics to bring fame to the club and be
a part of the resource for the community.

## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?

At most times you can see me developing games. Besides that if I get a creative idea, I will plan on making the application. I like C++ as my main programming language but as a developer I need to adjust my preferances and I am ready to adjust.
